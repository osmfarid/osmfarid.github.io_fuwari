## Creating a Personal Blog from Scratch

I've tried many ways to organize my thoughts and discoveries â€“ tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/), and even plain text files. But everything ended up scattered across my devices. I needed a central, public space to share my ideas and create a digital home for my writing.

The solution? A personal blog.

I used this awesome template for this

::github{repo="saicaca/fuwari"}

The template offers a wide range of features. My next planned enhancement is to implement a Table of Contents (TOC) for posts.
